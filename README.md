### Project for: Laboratorio di Programmazione di Sistemi Mobili 

# Idea
Create a mobile app to virtually track and rate your game colletion.

The inspiration for the app is the site [LetterBoxd](https://letterboxd.com) where you can do the same things but with the movie.


# What the app can do

</center>

- Create and custom your profile with:

  - pfp;

  - game accounts (PSN, Steam, Xbox);

  - favorite games.

- Track the games you have played and save this information:

  - the date of when we started it and when we completed it;

  - a rating from 1 to 5, represented by stars;

- Look at all the games added to the Vault, and:

  - filter by name;

  - delete game with a swipe

- Search for a game by title or search for the entire series directly
 (powered by [Rawg](https://rawg.io/)).
